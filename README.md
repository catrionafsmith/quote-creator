This is a Zen quote generator based on Angela Yu's 'Kanye Quote Generator' from her #100DaysofPython project. 
When the python code is run, a TKinter window appears, and when you click on the pink lotus flower a random inspirational quote is requested from the 'Zen Quotes API' and posted to the window. This quote generator was made to celebrate completion of my #100DaysofCode, and to generate a positive daily inspirational message!

Built with: An initial Kanye West quote API, and Kanye images and icons were provided by Angela Yu. The images, Tkinter window dimensions and API were changed to adapt the project.

What I learned: I learned how to use APIs to request data, and also how to create a GUI using Tkinter and Python.

Source: This quote generator was created based on Angela Yu's 'Kanye Quote Generator' in her #100Days of Python course.
